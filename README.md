# Gephi TwitterStreamingImporter Media Downloader

This small Python script takes a .csv export generated by the fantastic
[GephiStreamer Plugin](https://github.com/totetmatt/GephiStreamer) identifies
the tweets and then downloads the embedded media including...

* Photos
* Videos
* Animated Gifs

The script will also generate a report, allowing quick matching back to
your original CSV.

This script was created at the request of the AOIR Digital Methods Workgroup.

## Instructions
### I use Python, I know what I'm doing...
Great! This script requires [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org) and was
written in Python 3.6.
1. Download the script
2. Ensure your gephi export .csv is in the same folder as the script
3. Edit the `credentials.py` file so that...

        CONSUMER_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY'
        CONSUMER_SECRET = 'YOUR_SECRET'

4.  Run `python download_twitter_media.py`
5. Follow the on-screen instructions

### I don't use Python / I don't know what I'm doing...
Not a problem, this script is for people like you!

##### 1. Install your Python Environment
**NOTE: If you already have Miniconda / Anaconda installed on your
machine, skip this step**.

Install either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
 or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to give yourself an up to date Python environment
that is seperate from any default environments on your machine.


If installing Anaconda you want...
* Python 3
* 64bit Graphical Installer

If installing Miniconda you want...
* Python 3
* most likely 64bit
* .pkg installer if you are on MacOS

**What's the difference?**
Anaconda is better overall for beginners as it comes preloaded with a lot of packages and
a GUI to launch different tools. If you want to get more into Python in the future
I'd recommend Anaconda. However it is also a large download so if bandwidth
or hard disk space is an issue, go for Miniconda.
